## How do you list a directory?
A common way to list a directory in python is by importing
the os module and using the command os.listdir(). You will
need to specify the certain area of the directory to list but 
using "." will list the current subcategories inside that path.


## What does argv contain?
Argv is an argument used for python scripts. The first part of
the argv command is to call for the python file and then the 
second part are user specified arguments to determine which 
directories the script should explore.
